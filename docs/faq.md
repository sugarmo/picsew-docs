## Why after adding a device mockup, viewing it in the system album, the top and the bottom of the image are both cut off?

This is the display problem of the system album. Double-click the image to zoom in, then pinch to zoom out, now you can see the complete image.

## Why does the Web Snapshot extension show a blank page on launching?

The Web Snapshot extension needs the same network access permission as the host application. If you have not yet authorized the host application to access the network, there will be a blank page on launching.
